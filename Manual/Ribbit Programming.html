                <h2>On the Subject of Ribbit Programming</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Ribbit</p>
                <p>This module has four directional arrows, a button in the middle of the arrows, a start and reset button, a small input display, and a large game of “Frogger”.</p>
                <p>From bottom to top, you are shown:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A thin patch of grass (the starting point) with a frog. You will be controlling this frog.</li>
                    <li>A street with multiple cars. (Initially frozen in place.)</li>
                    <li>A second thin patch of grass (the middle point).</li>
                    <li>A river with logs and turtles. (Initially frozen in place.)</li>
                    <li>A final thin patch of grass with gaps (the goal points).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The goal is to pre-program the movements of the frog such that it moves from the bottom patch of grass to the top goal points, whilst weaving through the traffic in the streets and whilst jumping on the logs and turtles in the river.</p>
                <p>The frog can be programmed to either move up, right, down, left, (with the directional buttons on the D-Pad) or wait (with the central button on the D-Pad). Moving the frog in any direction will cause it to jump one unit in the given direction.</p>
                <p>The length of one unit is illustrated along the top and right of the module via short lines. The patches of grass are each one unit long, and the street and river are each four units long.</p>
                <p>The cars, turtles, and frog are one unit long and one unit wide. The logs will be one unit long and can be several units wide. The groups of turtles can be several units wide.</p>
                <p>If the frog jumps onto a log or turtle, the frog will move at the same rate as the log or turtle it is standing on.</p>
                <p>Unlike the frog, all of the obstacles move a set amount of sub-units instead of whole units. Every step in the program will cause each car, log, and turtle (or obstacle) to move that many sub-units.</p>
                <p>For each step of the program, the frog will do its movement at the same time of the obstacles’ movement.</p>

                <h3>How can the program stop?</h3>
                <p>If any of the following occurrences happen, the module will strike and reset:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The frog dies upon getting hit by a car.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Specifically, any amount of sub-units is shared between the frog and a car.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The frog dies upon falling into the river.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Specifically, no units are shared between the frog and any log or turtle.</li>
                            <li>The frog can die simply by jumping directly into the river.</li>
                            <li>The frog can also die if it gets shoved off the log or turtle it is standing on. If the frog is standing on a log or turtle, and it reaches the edge of the screen, the log or turtle will wrap around, but the frog will not. This can cause the frog to get shoved off and fall into the river.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The frog dies of boredom.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Specifically, if five steps in the program have occured without the frog jumping to a new position. (The frog may be moving on a turtle or log at this time, but this isn’t considered movement in this context.)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The frog steps on the top patch of grass instead of a goal.</li>
                    <li>There are no more instructions in the program. This will kill the frog immediately.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A skull and crossbones will appear at the location of the frog’s death. Press the ‘R’ button to reset to the initial state of the module.</p>
                <h3>Obstacle direction and position</h3>
                <p>The logs in the river will always move right.</p>
                <p>The turtles in the river will always move left.</p>
                <p>The cars in the streets may move either direction. The cars will be facing in the direction that they move.</p>
                <p>All obstacles will start in whole-unit positions. No obstacle will start at a sub-unit position.</p>

                <h3>Determining the speed of the cars</h3>
                <p>Streets are numbered 1-4, from bottom to top.</p>
                <p>Take the battery count (adding or subtracting 4 until it falls into the range of 1-4). This street’s car will move <em>1 tenth</em> of a unit per step in the program.</p>
                <p>For the first three characters in the serial number, assign any letter to its alphabetical position, and set any 0’s equal to 10. The remaining three streets’ cars will move <em>Z tenths</em> of a unit per step in the program.</p>
                <h3>Determining the speed of the logs and turtles</h3>
                <p>Rivers are numbered 1-4, from bottom to top.</p>
                <p>Take the indicator count (adding or subtracting 4 until it falls into the range of 1-4). This street’s car will move <em>1 tenth</em> of a unit per step in the program.</p>
                <p>For the last three characters in the serial number, assign any letter to its alphabetical position, and set any 0’s equal to 10. The remaining three streets’ cars will move <em>Z tenths</em> of a unit per step in the program.</p>
                <h3>How does the module solve?</h3>
                <p>Upon moving the frog to any one of the three goals at the top of the screen, the program will stop, and the module will disarm.</p>
